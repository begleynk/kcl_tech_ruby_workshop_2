# Ruby Workshop #2

This week we made a super simple Rails app to look at how Rails handles routing and how controllers invoke templates.

### test_app

To run the test_app server, point your terminal to the project directory, and run the following commands:

	bundle install		# downloads all the gems you need
	rails s   			# starts the server (short for "rails server")
